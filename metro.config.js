// outside both the project root and watchFolders. Pointing nodeModulesPaths at
// node_modules makes those imports resolve against this app's own
// dependency tree instead, which is where they belong: the app has to install
// what the modules it shares actually need (fast-xml-parser, zod), and the two
// package.json files stay independent.
